# Framework flight

## [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) + [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)

- Used [asdf](http://asdf-vm.com/) for installing/managing erlang and elixir.
  - Took me a while to get erlang/elixir installed, because I had some missing dependencies before using `asdf`. For me it was openssl and/or libssl-dev: `sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev`.
- Phoenix **really** wants you to build a web front-end. The app it scaffolds is filled with templates, views, etc. -- feels very ruby on rails. Which isn't necessarily bad, it's just very much _"this is how you build your app"_.
  - The gen tool has `phx.gen.json` which will scaffold the schema, controller, json resource view, and organize it into a context.
